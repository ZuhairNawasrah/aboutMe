# Guessing game about me.

I build a game that let the user guess some basic data about me. The purpose of it just for fun, where the first part of the game was with (YES/NO) questions, and that is the easiest part of the game, and the second part is a little bit harder, which was guess the answer without giving a choices to the user, but it has more than one attempt, as well as a hint that's appear as alert after each attempt.
