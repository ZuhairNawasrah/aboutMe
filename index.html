        <p>Hello everybody, my name is Zuhair Nawasrah, I got a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering within just
            four years, one of them at Tafila Technical University (TTU), and the last three years at Balqa' Applied
            University. After graduation, i worked at KEPCO power plant for three years, one of them as a Performance
            Engineer, and the rest of the period as an Operation Engineer.</p>
        <p>My essential goal in this life is to find my passion in which field, and then to work at that field, even if
            I have to ignore four years of study, and other three years of work experience to achieve that goal, because
            the best thing in this life is to have fun with your work, so you become a creative person in your job.</p>
